Developing IDMs
===============

Development of Information Delivery Manuals for specific exchange scenarios can be accomplished by the use of the instruction prepared by buildingSMART known as the IDM Methodology. A specific version of the buildingSMART IDM methodology has been submitted to ISO and published as [ISO Standard 29481-1:2010 “Building information modelling - Information delivery manual - Part 1: Methodology and format”](https://www.iso.org/standard/60553.html).

Finding and publishing Information Delivery Manuals
---------------------------------------------------

buildingSMART is publishing the 'Use-Case Management Tool' (UCM) as the official repository for IDMs and use-cases. You can access the UCM at [https://ucm.buildingsmart.org/](https://ucm.buildingsmart.org/)

Developing an IDM and/or use-case
---------------------------------

The IDM methodology can be used at various market levels (local/regional, national, multinational or international) for many types of digital ways of working, across the spectrum of the built asset industry (buildings and civil infrastructure) and lifecycle of assets. Usually the following steps are followed:

### Stage 1: Initiation

1.  Identify the scope of the IDM, stakeholders and if an existing IDM can be used instead of developing a new one.
2.  Decide which level the IDM is aiming to reach:
    *   Local
    *   National
    *   Multinational
    *   International
3.  Form a team with representations from organisations according to the following rules
4.  Evaluation by buildingSMART (done by the use-case management tool team)

It should be noted that an Information Delivery Manual is a specification that may require:

*   Additions to the buildingSMART Data Dictionary;
*   Identification of relationships to existing data dictionaries currently in use;
*   Creation of exchange requirements (Information Delivery Specifications);
*   Use of other open data standards (e.g. infaML, CityGML, etc.) to enable data exchanges;

This stage can be compared to ISO stage 1: Proposal Stage in developing of ISO standards.

### Stage 2: Development

It will be sensible to consider whether the exchange requirements in the IDM should be limited to the use of items that are available in the IFC specifications and that have been implemented in existing software tools. Likewise it will be appropriate to invite people outside the development team to review the material.

This stage can be compared to ISO stage 2: Preparatory stage in development of ISO standards.

### Stage 3: Application to buildingSMART International

The proposed Information Delivery Manual could be submitted to the Use-Case Management tool that will make the material available for others.

This stage can be compared to ISO stage 3: Committee stage in development of ISO standards.

### Stage 4 optional: becoming an official bSI IDM

The draft of the proposed Information Delivery Manual is submitted to buildingSMART for thorough international review by buildingSMART.  The development team must reply timely to requests made by buildingSMART.

This stage can be compared to ISO stage 4: Enquiry stage in development of ISO standards.

### Stage 5optional: Approval

The final draft of the Information Delivery Manual will be reviewed by buildingSMART and will be accepted as an official buildingSMART Information Delivery Manual, or returned to the team for revision.

This stage can be compared to ISO stage 5: Approval stage in development of ISO standards.

### Stage 6: Publishing

After acceptance as an official buildingSMART Information Delivery Manual the Information Delivery Manual will be published at the buildingSMART [Use-Case management tool](https://ucm.buildingsmart.org/).

This stage can be compared to ISO stage 6: Publication stage in development of ISO standards.
