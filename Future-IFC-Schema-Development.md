Future IFC Schema Development
=============================

The further development of the IFC schema and its serializations are general carried out through [buildingSMART Standards Program Activities](https://www.buildingsmart.org/standards/activities/). The goal is to meet end user needs through consideration, debate, and testing before committing significant additions or changes to the schema.

In addition, minor changes or edits to the schema and documentation happen throughout the lifecycle of a particular version of the standard. Edits to the schema may happen in smaller increments through consultation with the IFC Release Managers

Major or minor, all issues can be addressed by end users by postingÂ issues in the appropriate [buildingSMART GitHub](https://github.com/buildingSMART) repository.
